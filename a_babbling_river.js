;`A babbling river beside you, ice cold snow melt free after a winter frozen in captivity, rushing down the
        mountain as
        if there will be no tomorrow. That’ll be you later.
        First, I compete against myself and against the hill, not others. Every passing year is a vain (in both
        senses
        of the word)
        fight against time, decay and deterioration. Age is not kind to the hill climber. VO2max declines by 1%
        every
        year, our maximum heart rate
        slows, our muscles weaken and recovery takes longer.
